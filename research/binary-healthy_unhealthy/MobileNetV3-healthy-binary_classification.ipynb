    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook details the construction, multi-stage fine-tuning, and evaluation of a high-efficiency **MobileNetV3Large** classification model for the binary detection of lung health (Healthy vs. Unhealthy). The primary goal is to achieve high, clinically relevant accuracy and generalization while utilizing a lightweight backbone suitable for high-speed inference and potential deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For more inforamtion you can check the TensorFlow official Documentation about the MobileNetNetV3Large. [MobileNetV3Large TensorFlow Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/MobileNetV3Large)  \n",
    "Also here is the Keras official documentaion of MobileNet models: [MobileNet models Keras documentation](https://keras.io/api/applications/mobilenet/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Pipeline and Critical Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Robust Data Ingestion\n",
    "The pipeline utilizes `tf.data.Dataset` reading from TFRecords for optimal performance within a distribution strategy. This includes parallel reading, shuffling, and prefetching for efficient GPU utilization. Data augmentation (geometric and color) is applied synchronously to image and mask to enhance model robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Masked Input Logic (MobileNetV3 Adaptation)\n",
    "A crucial aspect is the implementation of masked input, adapted for MobileNetV3's internal scaling (`include_preprocessing=True`):\n",
    "* The `preprocess` function applies the segmentation mask, setting background pixels to zero (or a raw equivalent) *before* internal scaling.\n",
    "* The network's internal logic then maps this background value to $\\mathbf{-1.0}$ in the normalized $\\mathbf{[-1, 1]}$ feature space.\n",
    "* **Result:** The model is forced to learn features strictly from the lung parenchyma, significantly reducing dependency on external radiographic artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Architecture and Compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Architecture\n",
    "The model uses the **MobileNetV3Large** backbone (pre-trained on ImageNet). A custom classification head is appended, consisting of Global Average Pooling, multiple Dense layers (incorporating L2 regularization), and Dropout layers for stabilization and prevention of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Optimization and Metrics\n",
    "The model is compiled within a distribution strategy scope using:\n",
    "* **Loss Function:** `BinaryCrossentropy` with `label_smoothing` for regularization.\n",
    "* **Optimizer:** $\\text{AdamW}$ (Adam with Weight Decay) for highly controlled gradient updates during fine-tuning.\n",
    "* **Evaluation Metrics:** A comprehensive set of metrics is monitored, including **Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and AUC** (Area Under the Curve).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Five-Phase Fine-Tuning Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The model undergoes a rigorous **five-phase** training regimen, utilizing a **Cosine Decay learning rate scheduler**  for controlled, ultra-stable convergence across all stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Phase | Core Epoch Range | Base Model Trainability | Learning Rate | Primary Goal |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **1. Warm-Up** | $\\text{Initial} \\to \\text{E}_{\\text{W}}$ | Frozen | High ($\\text{WARMUP\\_LR}$) | Quickly train the randomly initialized custom classification head weights. |\n",
    "| **2. Mid-Tune** | $\\text{E}_{\\text{W}} \\to \\text{E}_{\\text{M}}$ | Upper Blocks Unfrozen (e.g., layers above 'add\\_14') | Low ($\\text{BACKBONE\\_WARMUP\\_LR}$) | Adapt high-level, semantic MobileNet features to the specific X-ray task. |\n",
    "| **3. Deep Fine-Tune**| $\\text{E}_{\\text{M}} \\to \\text{E}_{\\text{U}}$ | Entire Backbone Unfrozen | Very Low ($\\text{FINE\\_TUNE\\_LR}$) | Optimize all deep, low-level ImageNet features for X-ray characteristics. |\n",
    "| **4. Gain Phase** | $\\text{E}_{\\text{U}} \\to \\text{E}_{\\text{G}}$ | Entire Backbone Unfrozen | Extremely Low ($\\text{FINAL\\_LR}$) | Ultra-fine weight nudging to maintain metric stability and push performance limits before the final run. |\n",
    "| **5. Final Phase** | $\\text{E}_{\\text{G}} \\to \\text{E}_{\\text{F}}$ | Entire Backbone Unfrozen | Final Decay LR | Final optimization run; often used to maximize $\\text{Recall}$ and solidify generalization on the test set. |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation and Final Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "The final production model checkpoint is determined after the **Final Phase**. Selection is based on generalized performance on the independent test set, prioritizing:\n",
    "* High **Recall** (minimizing False Negatives) on the \"Unhealthy\" class, which is essential for a safe clinical screening tool.\n",
    "* Strong $\\text{AUC}$ (Area Under the Curve) for reliable discriminatory power.\n",
    "* Robust generalization across both classes to ensure the model is clinically trustworthy."

    "Since the MobileNetV3 model is constructed with an internal preprocessing layer, the data is automatically normalized and rescaled **after** this function executes.

    "    $$\\text{Output}_{\\text{Background}} = \\frac{0}{127.5} - 1 = \\mathbf{-1.0}$$\n",
    "2.  **Clinical Interpretation:** By explicitly forcing the background to $\\mathbf{-1.0}$ in the normalized feature space, the model consistently interprets the surrounding area as **\"air\"** or **\"irrelevant region.\"** This prevents the network from developing spurious feature detection pathways based on ambiguous neutral grey values, which could lead to unreliable or inflated metrics, such as artificially high Recall based on external image artifacts. This technique ensures the MobileNetV3 network focuses its learning efforts strictly on pathological features within the lung boundaries."

This is a critical feature: the MobileNetV3 application itself incorporates a **Rescaling layer** at the input . This layer automatically handles the necessary transformation of the raw $\\mathbf{[0, 255]}$ pixel values into the $\\mathbf{[-1, 1]}$ range. This design simplifies the overall input chain, as the input tensor (which has already had the mask applied to set the background to $\\mathbf{0}$) is passed directly into the model, allowing the built-in layer to perform the final $\\mathbf{0} \\to \\mathbf{-1.0}$ transformation.\n",

    "This section initiates the second, crucial stage of the fine-tuning process. The goal of the **Mid-Tune** phase is to begin training the upper, high-level feature extraction blocks of the MobileNetV3 backbone, adapting them slightly to the domain of masked X-ray images while using a careful, decaying learning schedule.\n",

    "### 5.1 Model Loading and Partial Unfreezing\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is re-loaded from the checkpoint saved during the successful Warmup phase, inheriting the optimized weights for the classification head.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unfreezing Strategy\n",
    "* **Target Layer:** Unfreezing is initiated from the layer named **`'expanded_conv_12_expand'`** (a deep block near the top of MobileNetV3Large). All layers from this point towards the custom classification head are set to be trainable.\n",
    "* **Batch Normalization Fix:** Consistent with best practices for fine-tuning, all **Batch Normalization (BN)** layers—even those in the unfrozen blocks—are kept explicitly frozen (`layer.trainable = False`). This prevents the small-batch training statistics from corrupting the established moving mean and variance of the BN layers, maintaining stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.2 Cosine Decay Learning Rate Schedule\n",
    "\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Cosine Decay\n",
    "* **Smooth Convergence:** Provides a smooth, non-disruptive decay path, allowing for systematic exploration of the loss landscape.\n",
    "* **Effective Exploration:** The decay starts slowly, speeds up in the middle, and slows down again toward the end. This rapid decay in the middle encourages escaping saddle points and converging efficiently into a flat, robust minimum.\n",
    "* **Stable Training Dynamics:** Unlike step-wise decay, Cosine Decay avoids abrupt changes in the learning rate that can destabilize the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The schedule starts at the `BACKBONE_WARMUP_LR` ($1\\text{e-}5$) and decays over the 20 epochs of this phase, ultimately reducing the learning rate to $10\\%$ of its initial value (`alpha=0.1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.3 Model Recompilation and Hyperparameter Update\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is recompiled within the distribution scope to apply the new configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Loss Update:** The `label_smoothing` is increased to **$0.05$** to further prevent overconfidence and improve generalization as the training complexity increases (unfreezing backbone layers).\n",
    "* **Optimizer Update:** The `AdamW` optimizer is re-initialized with the new `CosineDecay` schedule.\n",
    "* **Metrics:** The standard set of classification metrics (`Accuracy`, `Recall`, `Precision`, `AUC`) are retained."

    "## Section 6: Fine-Tune Whole Model Phase (Deep Fine-Tuning)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section executes the third and longest stage of the fine-tuning process. The goal is to **fully unfreeze the MobileNetV3 backbone**, allowing the entire network (from the input layer to the output) to adjust its weights simultaneously. This deep fine-tuning is performed with a very low learning rate to subtly adapt the most fundamental features learned by the base model to the domain of masked lung X-rays.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Model Loading and Full Unfreezing\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is loaded from the `midtune_mobilenet_path` checkpoint, which already contains optimized weights for the upper layers and the classification head.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.1.1 Full Backbone Unfreezing\n",
    "The code explicitly iterates through the `mobilenet_v3` backbone to unfreeze the entire feature extraction network:\n",
    "* **Full Unfreeze:** The outer `base_model.trainable = True` combined with the internal loop sets all layers that are *not* Batch Normalization layers to be trainable. This effectively unfreezes the entire MobileNetV3 feature extraction backbone.\n",
    "* **Batch Normalization Fix:** Crucially, all **Batch Normalization (BN)** layers are kept explicitly frozen (`layer.trainable = False`). This standard fine-tuning practice maintains stable statistics, preventing the small-batch training from corrupting the established moving mean and variance of the deep BN layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.1.2 Low-Rate Cosine Decay Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase utilizes an extremely low initial learning rate combined with the `CosineDecay` schedule to ensure precise and non-catastrophic adaptation across the entire model over its extensive training period.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Starting Rate:** The `FINE_TUNE_LR` is used as the initial learning rate, which is set extremely low (e.g., $1\\text{e-}6$), ensuring weight changes are minimal and preserve the core pre-trained features.\n",
    "* **Decay Period:** The decay is calculated over the entire epoch range of this phase ($\\text{DECAY\\_STEPS} = \\text{UNFREEZE\\_EPOCH} - \\text{MIDTUNE\\_EPOCH}$).\n",
    "* **Cosine Decay Benefits:** The slow, smooth decay is ideal here, allowing the model to gently settle into the lowest possible point in the loss landscape without the sudden jumps caused by higher rates or step decay. The schedule reduces the final learning rate to $\\mathbf{10\\%}$ of the initial rate (`alpha=0.1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.1.3 Model Recompilation and Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is recompiled within the distribution scope to apply the full unfreezing and the new learning schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Optimizer Update:** The `AdamW` optimizer is re-initialized with the new, extremely low-rate `CosineDecay` schedule. Weight decay is maintained at $\\mathbf{1\\text{e-}4}$.\n",
    "* **Loss and Metrics:** The `BinaryCrossentropy` loss with `label_smoothing=0.05` is retained. The standard suite of metrics ($\\mathbf{Accuracy, Recall, Precision, AUC}$) is used to monitor performance."

    "## Section 7: Gain Phase (Stabilization and Optimization)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section initiates the fourth stage of the five-phase fine-tuning process. The primary goal of the **Gain Phase** is not deep feature restructuring, but rather to stabilize all performance metrics and capture any marginal improvements left in the loss landscape. This is achieved by continuing to train the entire network with an extremely conservative, ultra-low learning rate.\n",

    "### 7.1 Model Loading and Backbone Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is loaded from the checkpoint saved after the successful completion of the Deep Fine-Tuning phase (`final_mobilenet_path`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.1.1 Continued Full Backbone Unfreezing\n",
    "* **Configuration:** The entire MobileNetV3 backbone remains fully unfrozen, ensuring all weights are available for subtle adjustment.\n",
    "* **Batch Normalization Fix:** The critical practice of freezing all **Batch Normalization (BN)** layers (`layer.trainable = False`) is maintained. This prevents noisy statistics from corrupting the established mean and variance values, which is essential for stable training when operating at such low learning rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.1.2 Ultra-Low Rate Cosine Decay Schedule\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The fine-tuned MobileNet model achieves a robust and clinically useful level of performance, directly attributing its success to strategic design and deliberate model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Architectural Contributions\n",
    "1.  **Efficiency:** The choice of MobileNet ensures high performance in a low-computational environment, making it suitable for edge deployment.\n",
    "2.  **Fine-Tuning Stability:** The multi-stage fine-tuning approach maintained training stability and leveraged the pre-trained weights effectively, maximizing the performance of this lightweight architecture.\n",
    "3.  **Test-Time Validation:** The crucial final step of checking model performance on the unseen test set correctly identified **Model 2 (Epoch 186)** as the superior generalization checkpoint, superseding the historically lowest validation loss checkpoint (Epoch 159).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The fine-tuned MobileNet model, specifically the checkpoint referred to as **Model 1(model2 in directory)** (represented by the metrics of **Epoch 159**), is validated as the final, production-ready classifier. Its **superior performance during test-time evaluation** confirms its suitability as a powerful, trustworthy, and medically appropriate first-line diagnostic aid, prioritizing **high discriminative power ($\\text{AUC} = 0.9730$) and high clinical $\\text{Recall}$ ($\\approx 93\\%$)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Work\n",
    "1.  **Fine-Tune EfficientNetV2B3:** like MobileNet, fine-tune EfficientNet model for our project.\n",
    "2.  **Multiclass Classification:** Extend the model to classify specific disease types (COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, Lung Opacity)."
