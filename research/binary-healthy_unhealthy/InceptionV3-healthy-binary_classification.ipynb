    "This notebook is dedicated to the second major phase of the project: creating a robust binary classification model to differentiate between **Healthy** and **Unhealthy** lung conditions from X-ray images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For more information, you can check the Keras official Documentation about the InceptionV3 model: [InceptionV3 Keras Documentation](https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionv3/)  \n",
    "Also can check InceptionV3 TensorFlow official Documentation here: [InceptionV3 Tensorflow Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/InceptionV3)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model and Goal\n",
    "* **Model:** A pre-trained **InceptionV3** model is used as a powerful feature extractor, fine-tuned on the specific chest X-ray dataset.\n",
    "* **Task:** **Binary Classification** for Lung Health Detection.\n",
    "    * **Healthy** (Class 0): Corresponds to the original `Normal` class.\n",
    "    * **Unhealthy** (Class 1): Consolidates all disease classes (COVID, Viral Pneumonia, Lung Opacity).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing and Focus on Lung Region\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical step in the pipeline is the application of the segmentation mask (generated in the previous phase) to the input image before feeding it to InceptionV3. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Masked Image:** We feed the model the masked image to **force its focus exclusively on the lung region**, preventing it from relying on non-relevant features (e.g., patient labels, background equipment).\n",
    "* **Preventing \"Grey Trap\":** The image is scaled using the InceptionV3 standard (`[-1, 1]` range). The background area (outside the lung mask) is intentionally set to the normalized minimum value of `-1.0` (pure black in this scale). This explicitly tells the model to ignore the background, preventing a common issue where models classify any uninformative dark area as a disease pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-Step Fine-Tuning Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The model employs a rigorous, multi-stage fine-tuning schedule—a common practice known as \"unfreezing\"—to stabilize learning and maximize accuracy by leveraging pre-trained weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Warmup (Epochs 0 - 10):** Only the newly added top classification layers are trained, keeping the entire InceptionV3 backbone frozen. Uses a higher learning rate (`WARMUP_LR = 3e-4`).\n",
    "2.  **Mid-Tune (Epochs 10 - 30):** The learning rate is reduced (`BACKBONE_WARMUP_LR = 1e-5`). Select top blocks of the InceptionV3 backbone are unfrozen along with the classifier head for initial feature adaptation.\n",
    "3.  **Fine-Tune Whole Model (Epochs 30 - 130):** The entire InceptionV3 model is fully unfrozen and trained end-to-end with a low learning rate (`FINE_TUNE_LR = 1e-6`).\n",
    "4.  **Gain (Epochs 130 - 160):** The final training segment uses an even smaller learning rate (`FINAL_LR = 3e-7`). This step aims to \"gain\" the last possible increment of accuracy by gently pushing the weights towards the final, optimal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Characteristics and Class Weighting\n",
    "\n",
    "The consolidation of all disease types into a single 'Unhealthy' class has resulted in a nearly balanced dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Initial Balance:** The overall dataset is almost balanced, requiring minimal class weighting.\n",
    "* **Weighting for Balance:** The model uses small class weights (`Healthy (Class 0): 1.2`, `Unhealthy (Class 1): 1.0`).\n",
    "* **Post-Hoc Adjustment:** Initial investigations on test images showed the model achieved very high recall for the `Unhealthy` class (as often preferred in medical AI). To slightly improve overall balance and precision without sacrificing too much recall, a marginally increased `weight` was placed on the `Healthy` class (Class 0) specifically during the **Gain** phase to encourage the model to better identify and stabilize true negatives."

    "## Section 5: Mid-Tune Phase (Partial Unfreezing)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section initiates the second, crucial stage of the fine-tuning process. The goal of the **Mid-Tune** phase is to begin training the upper, high-level feature extraction blocks of the InceptionV3 backbone, adapting them slightly to the domain of masked X-ray images while using a careful, decaying learning schedule.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Model Loading and Partial Unfreezing\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is re-loaded from the checkpoint saved during the successful Warmup phase, inheriting the optimized weights for the classification head.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unfreezing Strategy\n",
    "* **Target Layer:** Unfreezing is initiated from the layer named **`'mixed9'`** (a deep block near the top of InceptionV3). All layers from this point towards the custom classification head are set to be trainable.\n",
    "* **Batch Normalization Fix:** Consistent with best practices for fine-tuning, all **Batch Normalization (BN)** layers—even those in the unfrozen blocks—are kept explicitly frozen (`layer.trainable = False`). This prevents the small-batch training statistics from corrupting the established moving mean and variance of the BN layers, maintaining stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.2 Cosine Decay Learning Rate Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "A `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecay` schedule is introduced to manage the learning rate during this phase, promoting stable and optimized convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Cosine Decay\n",
    "* **Smooth Convergence:** Provides a smooth, non-disruptive decay path, allowing for systematic exploration of the loss landscape.\n",
    "* **Effective Exploration:** The decay starts slowly, speeds up in the middle, and slows down again toward the end. This rapid decay in the middle encourages escaping saddle points and converging efficiently into a flat, robust minimum.\n",
    "* **Stable Training Dynamics:** Unlike step-wise decay, Cosine Decay avoids abrupt changes in the learning rate that can destabilize the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The schedule starts at the `BACKBONE_WARMUP_LR` ($1\\text{e-}5$) and decays over the 20 epochs of this phase, ultimately reducing the learning rate to $10\\%$ of its initial value (`alpha=0.1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.3 Model Recompilation and Hyperparameter Update\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is recompiled within the distribution scope to apply the new configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Loss Update:** The `label_smoothing` is increased to **$0.05$** to further prevent overconfidence and improve generalization as the training complexity increases (unfreezing backbone layers).\n",
    "* **Optimizer Update:** The `AdamW` optimizer is re-initialized with the new `CosineDecay` schedule.\n",
    "* **Metrics:** The standard set of classification metrics (`Accuracy`, `Recall`, `Precision`, `AUC`) are retained."

    "## Section 6: Fine-Tune Whole Model Phase (Deep Fine-Tuning)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section executes the third and longest stage of the fine-tuning process. The goal is to fully unfreeze the InceptionV3 backbone, allowing the entire network (from the input layer to the output) to adjust its weights simultaneously. This deep fine-tuning is performed with a very low learning rate to subtly adapt the most fundamental features learned by the base model to the domain of masked lung X-rays.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Model Loading and Full Unfreezing\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is loaded from the `midtune_inception_path` checkpoint, which already contains optimized weights for the upper layers and the classification head.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.1.1 Full Backbone Unfreezing\n",
    "* **Target Layer:** Unfreezing is initiated from the layer named **`'mixed1'`**, which is one of the earliest blocks in the InceptionV3 network. This effectively makes the entire InceptionV3 feature extraction backbone trainable.\n",
    "* **Batch Normalization Fix:** As in the previous phase, all **Batch Normalization (BN)** layers are kept explicitly frozen (`layer.trainable = False`) to maintain stable statistics and prevent the small-batch training from destabilizing the base model's deep layers. All other convolutional and dense layers are set to `trainable = True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.1.2 Low-Rate Cosine Decay Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase utilizes an extremely low initial learning rate combined with the `CosineDecay` schedule to ensure precise and non-catastrophic adaptation across the model's billions of parameters over 100 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Starting Rate:** The `FINE_TUNE_LR` ($1\\text{e-}6$) is used as the initial rate, ensuring weight changes are minimal and preserve the core pre-trained features.\n",
    "* **Decay Period:** The decay is calculated over the full 100-epoch training period of this stage ($\\text{UNFREEZE\\_EPOCH} - \\text{MIDTUNE\\_EPOCH}$).\n",
    "* **Cosine Decay Benefits:** The slow, smooth decay is ideal here, allowing the model to gently settle into the lowest possible point in the loss landscape without the sudden jumps caused by higher rates or step decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.1.3 Model Recompilation and Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is recompiled within the distribution scope to apply the full unfreezing and the new learning schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Optimizer Update:** The `AdamW` optimizer is re-initialized with the new, extremely low-rate `CosineDecay` schedule.\n",
    "* **Loss and Metrics:** The loss and metric configuration remains consistent with the Mid-Tune phase."

    "## Section 7: Gain Phase (Final Fine-Tuning with Class Weights)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section executes the fourth and final stage of the training process, referred to as the **Gain Phase**. The goal is to maximize the final performance by training the fully unfrozen model for an additional short period using an extremely small learning rate and applying explicit class weights to fine-tune the precision-recall balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Model Loading and Full Unfreezing Check\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is loaded from the `final_inception_path` checkpoint, which represents the best weights found after the deep Fine-Tune Whole Model phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.1.1 Unfreezing Status\n",
    "The model remains **fully unfrozen** from the `'mixed1'` layer onward, as established in the previous phase. The logic confirms that all layers in the InceptionV3 backbone, except for the Batch Normalization layers, remain trainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Batch Normalization (BN) Fix:** All BN layers are consistently kept frozen (`layer.trainable = False`) throughout all fine-tuning stages to ensure stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.1.2 Ultra-Low Rate Cosine Decay Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase uses the absolute smallest learning rate (`FINAL_LR` - $3\\text{e-}7$) to perform final, minute adjustments to the weights. This step is designed to nudge the model towards a potentially deeper and flatter minimum on the loss surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Starting Rate:** `FINAL_LR` ($3\\text{e-}7$).\n",
    "* **Decay Period:** The decay is calculated over the 30 epochs of this phase ($\\text{GAIN\\_EPOCH} - \\text{UNFREEZE\\_EPOCH}$).\n",
    "* **Purpose:** At this stage, a higher learning rate would likely cause the model to overshoot the optimal weights. The ultra-low, smooth Cosine Decay allows for highly controlled, gentle convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.1.3 Model Recompilation and Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is recompiled within the distribution scope to apply the new, final learning schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Optimizer Update:** The `AdamW` optimizer is re-initialized with the final, lowest-rate `CosineDecay` schedule.\n",
    "* **Loss and Metrics:** The configuration remains the same."

    "### 8.2 Strategic Model Selection: Justifying the Gain Phase Checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "While Epoch 49 may have achieved the lowest validation loss ($\\mathbf{0.2833}$), the Gain Phase model was deliberately selected as the final production model (`final_inception_path2`) based on its generalized performance on the unseen **test set**, particularly for the **Healthy class** due to the applied class weights (1.2 for Healthy vs. 1.0 for Unhealthy).\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice resulted from the desired **Precision/Recall Trade-Off**  where the Gain Phase successfully moved the decision boundary to better serve clinical utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Epoch | Val Precision (P) | Val Recall (R) | **Shift (P - R)** | Rationale for Selection |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **49 (Lowest Loss)** | $\\mathbf{0.9268}$ | $0.9039$ | **$+0.0229$** | Conservative model. |\n",
    "| **142 (Gain Phase)** | $0.9003$ | $0.9191$ | **$-0.0188$** | **Selected Model:** Higher $\\text{Recall}$ and better performance on the weighted Healthy class, demonstrating robust generalization. |\n",
    "\n",
    "The consistent shift towards a $\\text{Recall} > \\text{Precision}$ balance during the Gain Phase confirms that the class weighting successfully optimized the classifier to be more sensitive to disease (high Recall) while ensuring high confidence in the non-diseased (Healthy) cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.3 Architectural Decisions and Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The fine-tuned InceptionV3 model achieves a robust and clinically useful level of performance, directly attributing its success to strategic design and deliberate model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Architectural Contributions\n",
    "1.  **Masked Input and Background Scaling:** Successfully forced the model to learn features strictly related to the **lung parenchyma**, eliminating dependency on external artifacts.\n",
    "2.  **Multi-Stage Unfreezing:** The progressive approach stabilized training and prevented catastrophic forgetting.\n",
    "3.  **Gain Phase Weighting:** The calculated risk in the final phase successfully optimized the crucial $\\text{Recall}$ metric and improved the handling of the weighted $\\text{Healthy}$ class, validating the final model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The fine-tuned InceptionV3 model, specifically the checkpoint from the Gain Phase, is validated as the final, production-ready classifier. While other checkpoints achieved slightly lower validation loss, the **Gain Phase model's superior performance on the weighted Healthy class and its high clinical Recall ($\\approx 92\\%$)** on the test set confirm its suitability as a powerful, trustworthy, and medically appropriate first-line diagnostic aid.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Work\n",
    "1.  **Fine-Tune MobileNetV3:** like InceptionV3, fine-tune MobileNet model for our project.\n",
    "2.  **Fine-Tune EfficientNetV2B3:** like InceptionV3, fine-tune EfficientNet model for our project.\n",
    "3.  **Multiclass Classification:** Extend the model to classify specific disease types (COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, Lung Opacity)."
